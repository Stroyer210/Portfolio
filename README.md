## Description  :bookmark_tabs:

This was a really good project for me because it made me find a lot of resources and how to use them in my code to make it look nice.
Undoubtedly one of the reasons why I did build this project is because we need a Portfolio when applying to jobs so the employers can see some of our projects and whatnot, and that's why I spent a lot of time making it looks nice. In addition, you can see some of the projects I have worked before. And the most important of all, I learned how to make a website with a lot of CSS code.

## Installation :computer:

You are able to see my project in two different ways, depending on what you are looking for:

 1. If you only want to see the deployed website, you can go to this URL: https://stroyer210.github.io/Portfolio/
 2. If you want to see my code, you have my repository's folder on top, plus all the documents, such HTML, CSS and images.

## Usage :bar_chart:
If you are unable to open the URL, I attached a screenshot of it below:
    ![This is a screenshot of how the website looks on top.](Assets/Images/screenshot1.png)

    ![This is a screenshot of how the website looks when you are on the first project.](Assets/Images/screenshot2.png)
    ---
    ![This is a screenshot of how the website looks when you see the other projects.](Assets/Images/screenshot3.png)
    
As you can see, there is a little menu on the top-right of the website, so you can click any of them and it will take you to the respective section. If you go to my work, you can click on some of the projects I have done and it will take you to the deployed website, and also on the bottom you can find some links so you can contact me.
